Rapid Request Response consists of two modules:
  * Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)
  * Computer Aided Response (CAR)

**CAD module:**
  * allows management of a list of crew members eligible for alerts.
  * allows for sending an notification via sms to those eligible persons.

**CAR module:**
  * manages a list of known dispatchers.
  * when a meaningfull sms message is received from one of those dispatchers it will generate
an alarm and pop up a screen allowing for sending back a template response message to that dispatcher.
